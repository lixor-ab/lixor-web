### Bonnier
Bonnier ran an initiative to create a digital product focused on e-books and audiobooks for children. Lixor was a key player by contributing with: 

* Agile and lean training focusing on experience driven learning
* Structure a 12 week plan consisting of measurable goals together with the steering group
* Setting up workflow in order for the steering group to maintain the process themselves
