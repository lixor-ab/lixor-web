* wide screens
	* white space
	* fonts
	* images
	* “corners”, i.e. what happens on the side
* flex-box everything! :)
* all px should be rem!

* proper minification, possibly inlining everything
* deploy procedure
* performance fixing!
  * images & fonts first

* clean up the code - this is a messy prototype
* generate markup from markdown (?)
* use static code generation with React (?)


## Need Torfin:
* fine-tune white space
* fine-tune fonts
* logo - either Torfinn or Ylva (need SVG)
* what to do in wide :)


## Done

	* let’s start out with both typekit & google & have Torfinn select a one or the other later on
	* Roboto Slab 400 looks fatter than the PDF prototype?
	* Logotype as SVG? Ylva has that file right?
* icons
